/*
The sine and cosine functions can be used to model fluctuations in temperature data throughout the year.
An equation that can be used to model these data is of the form:

  y = A cos B(x - C) + D,

where A,B,C,D, are constants, y is the temperature in °C and x is the month (1–12).

A = amplitude = (ymax - ymin)/2
B = 2π/12
C = units translated to the right
D = ymin + amplitude = units translated up
